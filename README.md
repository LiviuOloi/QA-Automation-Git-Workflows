# QA Automation Git Workflows

This repository is part of a larger QA Automation project and focuses on mastering **Git version control workflows** used in real-world software development teams.

The goal of this module is to practice working with branches, merges, and conflict resolution as part of building a structured automation framework.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project was created to:
- understand Git fundamentals
- practice working with branches
- simulate real merge conflicts
- learn how to resolve conflicts correctly
- get comfortable with GitHub workflows

It represents the **version control foundation** of a larger QA automation framework that is being built step by step across multiple modules.

## 🎯 What I Practiced

- Creating and switching branches
- Making changes on different branches
- Merging branches into main
- Handling merge conflicts
- Resolving conflicts manually
- Pushing changes to GitHub
- Understanding commit history

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- Git
- GitHub
- IntelliJ IDEA

---

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository contains simple files used to:
- generate conflicts
- test merge behavior
- practice resolving differences between branches

The structure is intentionally simple to focus on **Git workflows** rather than application logic.

## 🚀 How This Fits Into the Bigger Project

This module is part of a larger project where I am building an **API Test Automation Framework** using:
- Java
- RestAssured
- TestNG
- Maven

This repository covers the **version control and collaboration aspect** of that project, ensuring proper workflow management before scaling automation development.
